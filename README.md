# Node Snapclone
Studio 39's Snapchat Clone written in Node JS

To get started developing and commiting to the Snapclone project, clone the repository using any Git method you like - GitHub for desktop is easy to use.

```bash
https://github.com/Studio39/node-snapclone.git
```

Open up a command line shell at your clone location and run the following

```bash
npm install -d
```

This should install all the dependencies for the project, note you'll need npm installed to do this.

Now you can run the app using

```bash
node bin/www
```

If you have nodemon it's helpful to use that as every time you make changes to a file the server is auto restarted.

Install nodemon by writing in command line

```bash
npm install nodemon -g
```

now with nodemon you can start the server with:

```bash
nodemon bin/www
```
